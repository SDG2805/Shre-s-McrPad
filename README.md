# Shre-s-McrPad
Hi, Everyone!
I'm Shreyas and with the help of Hack Club, have I designed a custom Macropad!

Here you can take a look at my schematic for the Macropad which basically shows how the different components have to be connected.

In the following image you're able to look at the whole pcb!

The case and knobs are 3d-printed which will be assembled using screws for the upper and lower part of the body whilst the knobs will just fit on "rotary encoders".
